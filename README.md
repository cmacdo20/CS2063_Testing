# CS2063_Testing

This is the repository for the CS2063 term project 
By: Team 11, Connor MacDonald and Zachary Nickerson

I'm not that well versed in Git and GitHub so currently the whole project is contained in the MenuServer.zip file on the main branch, and the game its self without any menus is on the master branch.

Testing was done using a Pixel A4 emulator and a physical Samsung Galaxy S20. We also attempted to test using a Samsung A5. However, usning this device caused the app to crash when starting the game.
